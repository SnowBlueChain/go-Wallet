Wallet functionalities handling BTC, BCH and so on. Currencies would be added step by step.

## Requirements
- Bitcoin Core 0.18+
- MySQL 5.7
- Golang 1.13+
- Docker

## Wallet Type
This is explained for BTC for now.
There are mainly 3 wallets separately and these wallets are expected to be installed each diffrent devices.

### Watch only wallet
- This wallet could access to BTC Network
- Only Bitcoin public address is stored. Private key is NOT stored here for security reason. That's why this is called watch only wallet.
- It works for creating unsigned transaction, sending signed transaction and monitoring trasaction status.

### Keygen wallet as cold wallet
- This wallet is key management functionalities. It generates seed and private keys as HD wallet and exports address for watch only wallet.
- Sign unsigned transaction as first signature. Multisig address can not be completed by only this wallet.
- Outside network is not used at all because of cold wallet.

### Signature wallet as cold wallet
- This wallet is signature management for authorization by multi-signature address. It also generates seed and private keys for authorization accounts.
- Sign unsigned transaction as second sigunature. Mustisig address must require this wallet.
- Outside network is not used at all because of cold wallet.


## Install on local
At least, one bitcoin core server and 3 different databases are required.  
After [bitcoin core installation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md) is done
```
# run database on docker
$ docker-compose up btc-wallet-db btc-keygen-db btc-signature-db

# run bitcoind
$ bitcoind

# create wallets separately
$ bitcoin-cli createwallet watch
$ bitcoin-cli createwallet keygen
$ bitcoin-cli createwallet sign
$ bitcoin-cli listwallets
[
  "",
  "watch",
  "keygen",
  "sign"
]

# build source
go build -i -v -o ${GOPATH}/bin/wallet ./cmd/wallet/
go build -i -v -o ${GOPATH}/bin/keygen ./cmd/keygen/
go build -i -v -o ${GOPATH}/bin/sign ./cmd/signature/
```

### Configuration
- [wallet.toml](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/data/config/btc/wallet.toml)
- [keygen.toml](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/data/config/btc/keygen.toml)
- [signature.toml](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/data/config/btc/signature.toml)

## Example
- [see scripts](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/tree/master/scripts/operation)
- [see Makefile](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/Makefile)

### Setup for any keys
- [see scripts](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/scripts/operation/generate-key-local.sh)

Keygen wallet
```
# create seed
keygen create seed

# create hdkey for client, receipt, payment account
keygen create hdkey -account client -keynum 10
keygen create hdkey -account receipt -keynum 10
keygen create hdkey -account payment -keynum 10

# import generated private key into keygen wallet
keygen import privkey -account client
keygen import privkey -account receipt
keygen import privkey -account payment

# export created public address as csv
keygen export address -account client
keygen export address -account receipt
keygen export address -account payment
```

Sign wallet
```
# create seed
sign create seed

# create hdkey for authorization
sign create hdkey

# import generated private key into sign wallet
sign import privkey

# import pubkey exported from keygen wallet into sign wallet
sign import address -account receipt -file xxx.csv
sign import address -account payment -file xxx.csv

# generate multisig addresses
sign add multisig -account receipt
sign add multisig -account payment

# export multisig address
sign export multisig -account receipt
sign export multisig -account payment
```

Keygen wallet
```
# import multisig address generated by sign wallet
keygen import multisig -account receipt -file xxx.csv
keygen import multisig -account payment -file xxx.csv

# export addresses of multisig account for watch only wallet
keygen export multisig -account receipt
keygen export multisig -account payment
```

Watch wallet
```
# import addresses generated by keygen wallet
wallet import address -account client -file xxx.csv
wallet import address -account receipt -file xxx.csv
wallet import address -account payment -file xxx.csv
```

### Operation for receipt action
```
# check client addresses if it receives coin
wallet create receipt

# sign on keygen wallet
keygen sign -file xxx.file

# send signed tx
wallet send -file xxx.csv

```

### Operation for payment action
```
# check payment_request if there are requests
wallet create payment

# sign on keygen wallet for first sigunature
keygen sign -file xxx.file

# sign on sign wallet for second sigunature
sign sign -file xxx.file

# send signed tx
wallet send -file xxx.csv

```

## TODO
- [x] Change ORM to sqlboiler
- [x] Implement proper database transaction.
- [ ] Re-design procedure for creating Multisig address.
- [ ] Backup/Restore for wallet.dat. If wallt.dat is broken, it's not easy to recover.
- [ ] Refactoring logic for unsigned transaction creation.
- [ ] Flexible multisig proportion M:N. For now only 2:2 fixed proportion is available.
- [ ] Multisig-address is used only once because of security reason, so after tx is sent, related receiver addresses should be updated by is_allocated=true.
- [ ] Tweak key generation logic for multisig address for BCH.
- [ ] Lock/Unlock wallet for security reason, authorized operator is available.
- [ ] Various monitoring patterns to detect suspicious operations.
- [ ] Sent tx is not proceeded in bitcoin network if fee is not enough comparatively. So re-sending tx functionality is required adding more fee.
- [ ] Scaling Bitcoin Core server and synchronize wallet.dat among Bitcoin Core cluster.
- [ ] High coverage of UnitTest.
- [ ] Add CircleCI or other CI service
- [ ] Add new coins like Ethereum.
