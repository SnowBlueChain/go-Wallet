Wallet functionalities handling BTC, BCH and so on. Currencies would be added step by step.

### Note
Drastic refactoring is ongoing

- handling bitcoin core version 0.19
- any comments should be English, not Japanese
- apply for domain driven design

## Requirements
- Bitcoin Core 0.18 minimum
- MySQL 5.7
- Golang 1.13+
- Docker

## Wallet Type
This is explained for BTC for now.
There are mainly 3 wallets separately.

### Watch only wallet
- This wallet could access to BTC Network
- Only Bitcoin public address is stored. Private key is NOT stored here for security reason. That's why this is called watch only wallet.
- It works for creating unsigned transaction, sending signed transaction and monitoring trasaction status.

### Keygen wallet as cold wallet
- This wallet is key management functionalities. It generates seed and private keys as HD wallet and exports address for watch only wallet.
- Sign unsigned transaction as first signature. Multisig address can not be completed by only this wallet.
- Outside network is not used at all because of cold wallet.

### Signature wallet as cold wallet
- This wallet is signature management for authorization by multi-signature address. It also generates seed and private keys for authorization accounts.
- Sign unsigned transaction as second sigunature. Mustisig address must require this wallet.
- Outside network is not used at all because of cold wallet.


## Install on local
- At least, one bitcoin core server and 3 different database are required.
```
# after bitcoin core installation is done
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md

# for database on docker
docker-compose up btc-wallet-db btc-keygen-db btc-signature-db

# build src
go build -i -v -o ${GOPATH}/bin/wallet ./cmd/wallet/
go build -i -v -o ${GOPATH}/bin/keygen ./cmd/keygen/
go build -i -v -o ${GOPATH}/bin/sign ./cmd/signature/
```

### Configuration
- [wallet.toml](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/data/config/btc/wallet.toml)
- [keygen.toml](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/data/config/btc/keygen.toml)
- [signature.toml](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/data/config/btc/signature.toml)

## Example
- [see scripts](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/tree/master/scripts/operation)
- [see Makefile](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/Makefile)

### Setup for any keys
- [see scripts](https://github.com/hiromaily/go-bitcoin/blob/master/scripts/operation/generate-key-local.sh)

Keygen wallet
```
# create seed
keygen create seed

# create hdkey for client, receipt, payment account
keygen create hdkey -account client -keynum 10
keygen create hdkey -account receipt -keynum 10
keygen create hdkey -account payment -keynum 10

# import generated private key into keygen wallet
keygen import privkey -account client
keygen import privkey -account receipt
keygen import privkey -account payment

# export created public address as csv
keygen export address -account client
keygen export address -account receipt
keygen export address -account payment
```

Sign wallet
```
# import multisig address generated by sign wallet
keygen import multisig -account receipt -file xxx.csv
keygen import multisig -account payment -file xxx.csv

# export addresses of multisig account for watch only wallet
keygen export multisig -account receipt
keygen export multisig -account payment
```

Watch wallet
```
# import addresses generated by keygen wallet
wallet import key -account client -file xxx.csv
wallet import key -account receipt -file xxx.csv
wallet import key -account payment -file xxx.csv
```

### Operation
```
# check client addresses if it receives coin
wallet create receipt

# sign on keygen wallet
keygen sign -file xxx.file

# send signed tx
wallet send -file xxx.csv
```
